# Math Master
Currently the program contains a ASP.net application with an React frontend and a terminal application that creates calculation sheets for primary school children. They need to be executed seperately right now but will be linked in the future.

To run the project React, ASP.net and Node.js need to be installed.

Also there is an error at the download button, so the PDF you can not get. At https://localhost:44488/myTest after you started the project, it should work that you get the PDF "calculation" one time. I hope it works atleast a little bit, because we have done it with direct paths. So you can't really see my (Luggi) project working. But all in all it did work, atleast at my own Laptop.
